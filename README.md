# 🧠 Neural Dev in the Python Matrix

## Hello, traveler of the GitHub realms! 👋

I'm a developer dwelling in a time where **Python is the new Latin**  
and neural networks are the **alchemy of the 21st century**.

If Pythagoras wrote code — he’d choose Python.  
If Da Vinci built machines — he’d train them on tensors.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🐍 I code in **Python** like it’s a second language — for both humans and machines.
- 🤖 I build and train **neural networks** — vision, audio, language, generation.
- 🧠 I explore the edge between **science** and **software engineering**.
- 🌐 I design backend systems with **async power** and **API elegance**.

## 🛠️ My Stack

> Tools are extensions of the mind. These are mine:

### 🔧 Core Tech

- **Python** – obviously.
- `Django`, `Django REST Framework` — when I need full-stack backend zen.
- `aiohttp`,  — when I want async speed and simplicity.
- `Celery`, `Redis`, — for distributed task management.


### 🧠 ML / DL

- `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras` — model-building playgrounds.
- `Transformers` (🤗), `Diffusers`, `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`.
- `OpenCV`, `Librosa`, `torchaudio` — vision and sound tools.
- `scikit-learn`, `Optuna`, `MLflow` — experiments, pipelines, and tuning.

### 📦 DevOps & Tooling

- `Docker`, `Nginx`, `Gunicorn`, `Supervisor`.
- `Poetry`, `pip-tools`, `pre-commit` — clean, reproducible builds.
- `pytest`, `coverage`, `tox`, `mypy` — I test. I type. I ship.

## 🧬 Interests

- 🗣️ **Speech Synthesis & Voice Cloning** — neural voices with character.
- 🎨 **AI Art / Diffusion Models** — machines imagining worlds.
- 🧠 **Explainable AI** — making intelligence transparent.
- 🛰️ **Edge/Offline AI** — models where the cloud can't follow.
- 🌍 **Multilingual NLP** — giving machines the gift of language(s).

---

## 📡 APIs, Data & Beyond

- I've built APIs that **serve neural models in milliseconds**.
- I've processed **millions of records**, streamed **terabytes of audio**, and parsed **webs of unstructured chaos**.
- I believe in **event-driven systems**, **decoupled architectures**, and **observability** that actually works.

---

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate

I'm open to:

- 🤖 Research & experimental ML projects
- ⚙️ Building robust, async-first backends
- 📊 Data-rich pipelines, dashboards & tools
- 🧪 OSS contributions and cool side quests

## 🌌 Final Thoughts

> Code is a spell.  
> Python is my language.  
> Neural networks are my craft.  
> The future is my dataset.
